JupyterLab enables you to work with documents and activities such as Jupyter notebooks, 
text editors, terminals, and custom components in a flexible, integrated, and extensible manner.

The core target is to have a tool for data analysis and data visualization.
For that manner, Jupyter Notebooks are being used, which can be run interactively.


Getting started
---------------

Open the JupyterLab via the Tools embedded to the GI.cloud web-ui.

This working environment where you can inspect files and run python scripts.

To manually install required packages, you can open a ``terminal`` to execute linux commands.

.. note::

    If you want to experiment with different packages and dependencies, it is recommended to create a virtual environment.

Set up a venv with pip:

or with conda:

The most of the delivered Jupyter Notebook scripts can simply be executed sequentially.
That means that once you opened a ``.ipynb`` file, you can either run Cell by Cell by pressing ``shift + enter``, or go on tab 'run' and ``Run All Cells``.
